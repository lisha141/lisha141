Okay,so here I am in Sublime Text and I'm looking at the file called index.html,which is located in the examples, some extra folders that are inside the Lecture25 folder,namely css, fonts, and js folders.Now where did I get them?Well, they come from the installation or download, to be slides.But if we click on Getting started, the very first section here is Download, andwe could choose a whole bunch of different options here, but the simplest one is to choose Bootstrap itself.</section>

It's already compiled from some sources and you can just click Download.When you download this and unzip it, inside that zip file,you'll have three folders, and the three folders will be css, fonts and js.And if you open up the css folder, you'll see that this is where the those extra spaces and carriage returns wouldn't be downloaded because theydon't really make any difference.Then there is the fonts folder and we're not going to talk about this right now,but it's definitely needed for basic.</section>

And there's the js or JavaScript folder.And Bootstrap does have a JavaScript component, soyou're definitely going to need this.And again, there's two different files, there's bootstrap.js andthere's bootstrap.min.js.Now the min, again, is the minified version, spaces taken out,certain variables are renamed so they're not so long, and so on and so forth.order to get this file, I would go to jQuery.com and let'sgo back to the front page, jQuery.com, and I'll click on this Download link. </section>
